Goals:

* Build an intuitive GUI to Google Music using Curses



This script requires Simon Weber's [Google Play Music API](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API) 

Although originally forked from DanNixon's PlayMusicCL, I've barely used any of his code. I'd say about 95% at least is mine at this point, and it's probably much worse off for it - I just wanted to get a handle on using the gmusic api myself.
